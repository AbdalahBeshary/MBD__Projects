Simple simulation for operation modes of driver drowsness system By using state flow


The input of this systems:
  1-Camera
  2-FSR 
  3-Heart Rate sensor
  4-PushButton

the output:
  1-Buzzer
  2-TFT
  3-Vibration_motor
  4-GSM and GPS


System Operation

when camera detect driver is close eyes,he leaves steering wheel or Heart beat unstable , it make an alram is fired like Buzzer and TFT represent message,vibration motor
